This fuzzer tests if the application crashes when given such invalid
data. There are the following types of randomized tests:

- Changing bytes from a valid input
- Inserting bytes to or removing bytes from a valid input
- Changing the file extension

The 3 kind of changes might happens simultaneously. All valid inputs
should be inside the "inputs" directory (or any subdirectory that
branches from it). Logging happens into a file named "general.log", and
all failed tests are put inside the "crashed" directory, in a
subdirectory with a given timestamp. All passing tests are stored too,
but as a BSDIFF4-format patch inside the "log" directory.

For now, the configuration is hard-coded to give the random file inputs
to gwenview.
